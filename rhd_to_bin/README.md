You should test any changes to the code that you make. You can run test_ProcessRhd.py to do this. It will walk you through what to do in detail, but you need to install [this gdrive directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1co9X7UL66yczM1iGRlUCzbRB__GyKmRH?usp=sharing). You then need to run your newest version of ProcessRhd.py on the RHDs in that directory. The image included below contains inputs that you will need to replicate exactly to ensure correct results.
