### General Instructions

You can specify multiple input directories with RHD files. Doing this assumes that your probe setup is the same across experiments / directories.

The script will generate a <i>PASSED</i> file after the script finishes containing how many RHD files were processed.

### Development Tests

You should test any changes to the code that you make. You can run test_ProcessRhd.py to do this. Before running test_ProcessRhd.py you need to install [this gdrive directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1co9X7UL66yczM1iGRlUCzbRB__GyKmRH?usp=sharing). You then need to run your newest version of ProcessRhd.py on the RHDs in that directory. The image included below contains inputs that you will need to replicate exactly to ensure correct results.
